Mute New Tabs
===
Chrome allows websites to make noise with your explicit approval.  Mute New Tabs
is a Chrome extension that fixes this peculiar design mistake.  It uses Chrome's
tab muting API to automatically mute new tabs.  If needed, you can un-mute a
tab by clicking the mute/un-mute icon on the tab itself.

**Note: you must enable "Tab audio muting UI control" in `chrome://flags` to be
able to click the mute/un-mute icon on the tab.**

**Note: to restore the "Unmute tab" and "Mute tab" context menu actions in
Chrome 64+, **disable** "Sound content setting" in `chrome://flags`.**

Besides muting new tabs, the extension also:

1.	Mutes tabs on startup, because Chrome doesn't remember which tabs were
	muted.

2.	Mutes the tab when you navigate to a different origin.

3.	Injects a [content script](https://github.com/ludios/mute-new-tabs/blob/master/unmute_content.js)
	on {youtube, vimeo, soundcloud, twitter}.com
	([and more](https://github.com/ludios/mute-new-tabs/blob/master/manifest.json#L21))
	to unmute the tab when you click on an in-page volume control.  Clicking a
   volume control shows a clear intent to change the volume, so the tab mute
   shouldn't get in the way.

All four features can be toggled in the extension's popup window:

## Install from source

Note that if you install an extension from outside the Chrome Web Store, you'll see a
"developer mode extensions" nag popup every time you start Chrome, unless you're
using Chrome on Linux (lucky you!).  On other platforms, if you're crazy enough, you
[might be able to hexedit your Chrome binary](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23055651/disable-developer-mode-extensions-pop-up)
to get rid of it (I have not tested this).

1.	`git clone https://github.com/ludios/mute-new-tabs`

2.	Open `chrome://flags` in Chrome.

3.	Find **Tab audio muting UI control**, click "Enable", then restart Chrome.
	(Make sure to actually restart it, not just close one window.)

4.	Open `chrome://extensions` in Chrome.

5.	Check "Developer mode" at the top-right.

6.	Click "Load unpacked extension...", then select the cloned `mute-new-tabs` directory.

7.	Check "Allow in incognito" if you also want incognito tabs to be muted by default.
